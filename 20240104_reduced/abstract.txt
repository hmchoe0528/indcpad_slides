Title: IND-CPA^D and KR^D security of FHE and application to Threshold-FHE 

Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss the security notion of fully homomorphic encryptions (FHE) introduced by Li and Micciancio (Eurocrypt'21), namely IND-CPA^D and Key Recovery^D. Unlike the well-studied IND-CPA security of FHE, the attacker is given access to a decryption oracle for ciphertexts for which it should know the underlying plaintexts. Li and Micciancio singled out the CKKS FHE scheme by giving an IND-CPA^D attack on it and claiming that IND-CPA security and IND-CPA^D security coincide for FHEs on exact data. We correct the widespread belief according to which IND-CPA^D attacks are specific to approximate homomorphic computations. Indeed, the equivalency formally proved by Li and Micciancio assumes that the schemes are not only exact but have a negligible probability of incorrect decryption. However, almost all competitive implementations of exact FHE schemes give away strong correctness by analyzing correctness heuristically and allowing noticeable probabilities of incorrect decryption. We exploit this imperfect correctness, which led to a theoretical IND-CPA^D insecurity of the exact FHE schemes. We then extend this to threshold FHEs, when the correctness is similarly loose.
